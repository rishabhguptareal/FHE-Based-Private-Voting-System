A revolutionary decentralized voting system powered by Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) that sets new standards for electoral privacy and transparency. The protocol enables voters to participate in blockchain-based elections with mathematical guarantees of vote secrecy, while maintaining complete verifiability of results.





Core Features

Complete Vote Privacy: All votes are encrypted using FHE, ensuring that individual votes remain confidential even from validators and contract owners.
Verifiable Tallying: Despite votes being encrypted, the system can compute accurate vote counts through homomorphic operations.
Single Vote Guarantee: Each eligible address can vote exactly once, preventing double voting.


Technical Implementation:
Smart Contract Components:

Vote Storage: Encrypted votes stored as euint8 using TFHE library
Voter Tracking: Mapping of addresses to voting status
Time Management: Automated voting period enforcement
Proposal Management: Support for multiple voting options

Security Features:

Votes remain encrypted throughout the entire process
No intermediate decryption needed for vote counting
Tamper-proof vote recording using blockchain
Prevention of double voting through address tracking

Key Innovations:

Zero-knowledge vote casting: Voters' choices remain permanently encrypted and private, even from network validators
Homomorphic vote tallying: Precise vote counting without ever decrypting individual ballots
On-chain verification: Public auditability of voting process without compromising privacy
Sybil-resistant participation: Secure voter authentication without revealing identity
Real-time encrypted aggregation: Live election progress without exposing interim results

Technical Requirements

FHE-compatible EVM (e.g., Zama's zkEVM)
TFHE library integration
Client-side encryption capabilities
